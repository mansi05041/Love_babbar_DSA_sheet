## Question
Your task is to implement  2 stacks in one array efficiently.

### Input_output
Input : 
push1(2) <br />
push1(3) <br />
push2(4) <br />
pop1() <br />
pop2() <br />
pop2() <br />
Output : 3 4 -1

## Algorithm
 
- Implement two stacks having one top at -1 and other top at size as top1 and top2 respectively.
- Design all the methods accordingly to it.

Time Complexity: O(1) four all methods </br>
Space Complexity: O(1)
